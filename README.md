# Life Frontier Engagement (2022)
## Website Creation for Women Empowerment 

This study is to identify the economic activities of rural women and to examine the contributions they made to community development through their involvement in economic and development activities.  In this community, they offer some part time jobs along with salary to women who are illiterate, widow and single parent and help them towards their life. Here, this website will make the trust easy to manage their data, collecting donations, maintaining their work plans and for finding part time jobs. 
The main motive of creating this website is to spread awareness to all the women who are very needy and other women also. It is recommended that a non- governmental organization should be a base for supporting rural women. This website will be created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MYSQL languages. With the help of this website, they can use it for their planning purpose, managing data, job finding etc. The Design of the website will be created using HTML and CSS language and the working will be done using MYSQL language. The tabs that are to be added in our website are Home, About Us, Objective, Registration, Media, Admin and Contacts.
